On IMDb, a user rating is listed next to the title of every movie in the database. The rating is given on a scale of 0 to 10. For instance, the movie 'Good Will Hunting' (1997) has a rating of 8.3/10 based on votes from 732,710 users. This rating provides a measure of the movie's perceived quality.
In this context, explore the application of the mean (specifically, the arithmetic mean) in determining the ranking of movies on IMDb by following these tasks:
1.	Select a movie of your choice (for example, your favorite) and look it up on IMDb.
2.	Create a frequency distribution in a tool like Excel to record the ratings given by users. Confirm the calculation of the arithmetic mean as mentioned below the frequency distribution on IMDb. (Note: The actual average rating and the arithmetic mean might not always match. A brief explanation is provided.)
3.	Analyze the frequency distribution of the ratings for your chosen movie and consider whether the Arithmetic Mean is a suitable measure for representing the overall rating. Provide your reasoning.
Furthermore, take a look at "Les Misérables" (1935 and 2012), an original movie and its remake. Choose a remake according to your preference. Compare the distribution of votes (ratings) for the original and the remake. Calculate either the Arithmetic Mean or the Median (whichever is the standard) for both versions. Highlight the distinctions between the two rating distributions, utilizing the calculated measures, and propose reasons for the observed differences.
Solution : 
        As my project I take "Drishyam” (Malayalam movie ) and its remake Bollywood remake which is also named as "Drishyam” . In this report, we will conduct a comparative analysis of two Indian movies: "Drishyam" and "Kabir Singh," focusing on the ratings provided by the Indian audience. We'll examine the data collected in an Excel sheet, considering the rating and frequency of votes, and compare the mean and median calculated from the data to gauge the movies' popularity.
Mean and Median Calculation:
Mean and median were calculated to understand the central tendency of the ratings.
Arithmetic mean was found to be more closely aligned with the actual rating for both movies, with a slight difference of 0.1-0.2.
